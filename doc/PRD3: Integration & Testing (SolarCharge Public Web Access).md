# **PRD3: Integration & Testing (SolarCharge Public Web Access)**

**Phase:** 3 of 3 \
 **Authority:** Inherits from Meta-PRD (v1.0) \
 **Source Context:** PRD-WebAccess.md


---


## **a. Purpose**

This phase completes the **end-to-end integration** between the publicly hosted frontend (PRD1) and the backend exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel (PRD2). It validates functional flows, security, and usability to ensure a seamless experience for remote users.

**Explicitly Out of Scope:**



* Any future feature enhancements (beyond remote access). \

* Paid service tiers (all testing must remain compatible with free GitHub Pages + Cloudflare Tunnel). \



---


## **b. In-Scope Features**



1. **Frontend–Backend Integration \
**
    * Replace `SOLARCHARGE_BACKEND_HOSTNAME` placeholder with the actual Cloudflare Tunnel hostname. \

    * Confirm frontend axios requests succeed against live backend API. \

2. **End-to-End Functional Testing \
**
    * Verify user stories: \

        * Remote monitoring of EV charging status. \

        * Remote start/stop of charging sessions. \

        * Manual “Max Charging” command execution. \

3. **Security Verification \
**
    * Confirm all requests use HTTPS. \

    * Validate that no router port forwarding is required. \

4. **Reliability Checks \
**
    * Confirm tunnel auto-reconnects on backend reboot. \

    * Validate system remains functional under normal usage conditions. \

5. **User Experience Validation \
**
    * Ensure UI behaves identically in local and remote modes. \

    * Document any discrepancies or latency issues. \



---


## **c. Out-of-Scope Features**



* Expansion of backend logic (charging algorithms remain unchanged). \

* Long-term monitoring of Cloudflare reliability (outside single-phase delivery). \

* Non-functional feature expansion (e.g., push notifications, analytics). \



---


## **d. Placeholders**



* **Final Replacement of <code>SOLARCHARGE_BACKEND_HOSTNAME \
</code></strong>
    * Must be replaced with deployed Cloudflare Tunnel URL (e.g., <code>https://solarcharge-api.tunnel.com</code>). \

    * Remove all placeholder/deprecation comments as per Meta-PRD Replacement Rule. \



---


## **e. User Flow**



* **User Access: \
**
    * Open public GitHub Pages frontend URL. \

    * Frontend loads with assets served via GitHub Pages. \

* **Backend Interaction: \
**
    * User initiates API-driven action (e.g., “Start Charging”). \

    * Frontend calls live backend via Cloudflare Tunnel hostname. \

    * Request flows securely through Cloudflare → local backend → charger hardware. \

    * Response updates frontend in real-time. \

* **User Experience: \
**
    * Remote access feels identical to local access. \

    * Confidence in security and reliability is achieved. \



---


## **f. Deliverables**



* Fully functional public deployment of SolarCharge web app. \

* Verified integration between frontend and backend over Cloudflare Tunnel. \

* Test results logged for functional, security, and reliability checks. \

* Documentation for: \

    * Deployment verification steps. \

    * Troubleshooting common integration issues. \



---


## **g. Handoff Contract**



* This is the final scoped PRD in the chain. \

* Placeholders (`SOLARCHARGE_BACKEND_HOSTNAME`) must now be replaced fully with live values. \

* No new placeholders may remain unresolved. \

* Future enhancements (if needed) must start as **new Meta-PRD revisions**. \



---


## **h. Contextual Notes (Transcript Fidelity)**

From original PRD:



* **User trust in security** → explicitly tested here. \

* **Low-cost requirement** → confirmed: GitHub Pages + Cloudflare Tunnel free tier deliver solution. \

* **UX parity** → validated across local/remote modes. \

* **Exploratory edge cases**: \

    * Latency impact of Cloudflare routing. \

    * Possible need for caching or offline fallback (not implemented here but noted for future). \



---


## **i. User Verification Steps**



1. Open GitHub Pages frontend from external device (not on local Wi-Fi). \

2. Confirm: \

    * Dashboard loads successfully. \

    * Charging status reflects real-time updates. \

    * “Max Charging” and “Stop Charging” commands work remotely. \

3. Verify HTTPS security (browser lock icon present, cert valid). \

4. Disconnect/reboot backend host → ensure tunnel auto-reconnects. \

5. Compare experience against local access — confirm no functional differences. \


**Known Incompletes:**



* Long-term monitoring of uptime not covered in PRD3. \

* Future optimizations (caching, performance tuning) outside current roadmap.
